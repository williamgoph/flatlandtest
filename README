==================
Pre-run Todo list
==================

1) Project was create in MS Visual Studio 2010 Express (sorry its the version that I have in my PC)

2) Attach DB Test/APP_Data/test.mdf (created in MSSQL Server 2005 Express - sorry again its the version that I have in my PC)

3) Just in-case it doesn't attach, create a DB name 'test' and execute Test/DBScripts/entity.sql

4) config file is in Test/config.json

5) Open the solution file (Test.sln)

6) In project explorer navigate to Models/entity.cs, in GetConfig function please change configFile variable as necessary (point it to where config.json is)

4.) Sorry I don't have any experience in unit testing in Microsoft environment.

-OPTIONAL-

5) 

6) Lessen DB transaction and implement data archiving.

7) I had simply used DataTable with undefined schema, schema will be define by the sql statement or stored procedure upon populating it. Though a bit crude but I had used it effectively and believe this is very dynamic and provide very good performance.

8) Rebuild the indexes.

9) LINQ or just I'll simply execute a sql query statement.
